Welcome to **Ladybird Keylogger**, your friendly, cute, and totally not-at-all suspicious bot that logs keys, takes screenshots, and snatches clipboard content like it's going out of fashion! 

Don't worry, though, it's all under control! In fact, the real star of the show here is a little ladybird, fluttering around collecting... well, data.

   Yep, Ladybird knows all those little taps on your keyboard.

2. **Snaps candid screenshots** 📸  
   Like a ninja with a camera! Say cheese!

3. **Collects clipboard content** 📋  
   Thought you'd keep something in your clipboard? Oh, Ladybird saw that.

4. **Sends it all to your personal Telegram bot** 📡  
   Because, you know, sharing is caring.
